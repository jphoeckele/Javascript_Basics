# treehouseJavascript

This is just a file that I created to display the content from TeamTreehouse's JavaScript tutorial. Most of this is very basic and so I am just using it to solidify my knowledge of Javascript. I may delete sections as I go or I may end up just commenting out code that is not being used. I haven't decided yet. This is just for practice.
